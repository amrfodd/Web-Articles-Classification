      "On the Open Connect team at Netflix, we are always working to enhance the hardware and software in the purpose-built Open Connect Appliances (OCAs) that store and serve Netflix video content. As we mentioned in a recent company blog post, since the beginning of the Open Connect program we have significantly increased the efficiency of our OCAs — from delivering 8 Gbps of throughput from a single server in 2012 to over 90 Gbps from a single server in 2016. We contribute to this effort on the software side by optimizing every aspect of the software for our unique use case — in particular, focusing on the open source FreeBSD operating system and the NGINX web server that run on the OCAs.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Members of the team will be presenting a technical session on this topic at the Intel Developer Forum (IDF16) in San Francisco this month. This blog introduces some of the work we’ve done.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Adding TLS to Video Streams\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In the modern internet world, we have to focus not only on efficiency, but also security. There are many state-of-the-art security mechanisms in place at Netflix, including Transport Level Security (TLS) encryption of customer information, search queries, and other confidential data. We have always relied on pre-encoded Digital Rights Management (DRM) to secure our video streams. Over the past year, we’ve begun to use Secure HTTP (HTTP over TLS or HTTPS) to encrypt the transport of the video content as well. This helps protect member privacy, particularly when the network is insecure — ensuring that our members are safe from eavesdropping by anyone who might want to record their viewing habits.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Netflix Open Connect serves over 125 million hours of content per day, all around the world. Given our scale, adding the overhead of TLS encryption calculations to our video stream transport had the potential to greatly reduce the efficiency of our global infrastructure. We take this efficiency seriously, so we had to find creative ways to enhance the software on our OCAs to accomplish this objective.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "We will describe our work in these three main areas:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Determining the ideal cipher for bulk encryption\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Finding the best implementation of the chosen cipher\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Exploring ways to improve the data path to and from the cipher implementation\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Cipher Evaluation\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "We evaluated available and applicable ciphers and decided to primarily use the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) cipher in Galois/Counter Mode (GCM), available starting in TLS 1.2. We chose AES-GCM over the Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) method, which comes at a higher computational cost. The AES-GCM cipher algorithm encrypts and authenticates the message simultaneously — as opposed to AES-CBC, which requires an additional pass over the data to generate keyed-hash message authentication code (HMAC). CBC can still be used as a fallback for clients that cannot support the preferred method.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "All revisions of Open Connect Appliances also have Intel CPUs that support AES-NI, the extension to the x86 instruction set designed to improve encryption and decryption performance.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "We needed to determine the best implementation of AES-GCM with the AES-NI instruction set, so we investigated alternatives to OpenSSL, including BoringSSL and the Intel Intelligent Storage Acceleration Library (ISA-L).\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Additional Optimizations\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Netflix and NGINX had previously worked together to improve our HTTP client request and response time via the use of sendfile calls to perform a zero-copy data flow from storage (HDD or SSD) to network socket, keeping the data in the kernel memory address space and relieving some of the CPU burden. The Netflix team specifically added the ability to make the sendfile calls asynchronous — further reducing the data path and enabling more simultaneous connections.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "However, TLS functionality, which requires the data to be passed to the application layer, was incompatible with the sendfile approach.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "To retain the benefits of the sendfile model while adding TLS functionality, we designed a hybrid TLS scheme whereby session management stays in the application space, but the bulk encryption is inserted into the sendfile data pipeline in the kernel. This extends sendfile to support encrypting data for TLS/SSL connections.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "We also made some important fixes to our earlier data path implementation, including eliminating the need to repeatedly traverse mbuf linked lists to gain addresses for encryption.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Testing and Results\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "We tested the BoringSSL and ISA-L AES-GCM implementations with our sendfile improvements against a baseline of OpenSSL (with no sendfile changes), under typical Netflix traffic conditions on three different OCA hardware types. Our changes in both the BoringSSL and ISA-L test situations significantly increased both CPU utilization and bandwidth over baseline — increasing performance by up to 30%, depending on the OCA hardware version. We chose the ISA-L cipher implementation, which had slightly better results. With these improvements in place, we can continue the process of adding TLS to our video streams for clients that support it, without suffering prohibitive performance hits.\r\n",

      "Netflix is a collection of microservices that all come together to enable the product you have come to love. Operating these micro services is also distributed across the owning teams and their engineers. We do not run a central operations team managing these individual services for availability. What we do instead is to invest in tools that help Netflix engineers operate their services for high availability and resiliency. Today, we are going to talk about one such tool recently built for Netflix engineers — Winston\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Problem space\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Consider a typical mid tier micro service at Netflix. It’s a single purpose service hosted on AWS. It uses Jenkins for builds, Spinnaker for deployment and Atlas for monitoring. Alerts are configured on top of metrics using the Atlas stack language. Atlas supports triggering a set of predefined actions when the alert fires, namely instance level remediation (terminate instance, reboot, remove from service discovery etc.), escalations (email, page) or publish to SQS for further integration.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Any action beyond the small set already supported is not a first class citizen within the Atlas framework to reduce complexity and manage resiliency of Atlas itself. Let’s call any of these custom steps for diagnostics and remediation a runbook. Hosting and executing these runbooks usually took the form of\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "An email or page to a human who has either documented these runbooks on a wiki/doc or written one off tools and scripts to code it up. A custom micro service that listens to the SQS integration point from Atlas and implements the run book.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Both of these approaches have drawbacks. Escalating to humans to have them do manual repeatable tasks is not the best use of our engineer’s time. No one likes to get paged and wake up in the middle of the night to follow some documentation or kick off a script or a tool that a piece of software could have easily done.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Building a custom micro service means that the application team now needs to take on the additional burden of keeping the availability and resiliency of that service high, build integration with Atlas or other monitoring tools in use, manage deployment lifecycle, deprecation cycles for dependencies and worry about safety and security as well. Engineers would rather not deal with these ongoing infrastructure tasks just to host and execute their scripts that encapsulate their business logic.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Winston was created to help engineers achieve their runbook automation without managing the infrastructure and associated core features. And in case you are wondering, it’s named after Winston Wolfe, a character from the movie Pulp Fiction who has a “runbook” to solve problems and creates a controlled and safe environment to execute them.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Winston to the rescue\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Winston provides an event driven runbook automation platform for Netflix engineers. It is designed to host and execute runbooks in response to operational events like alerts. Winston’s goal is to act as Tier-1 support for developers where they can outsource their repeatable diagnostic and remediation tasks and have them run automatically in response to events.\r\n",

      "3 preview comments per item are visible in feed, and no preview comments are visible in grid view.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "However, we had been sending up to 20 comments to the client with each bundle. Originally, this was intended as an optimization to make the “View all comments” screen load faster. But when viewed holistically, this now seems like a poor trade-off for these reasons:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "*Media are viewed more commonly than their comments, and we should optimize for the common case.\r\n",

But it was still unclear how much of a user-facing impact it would have. After all, this only makes a difference in the order of tens of kilobytes per payload, a difference that is dominated by the size of photo or video files. We hypothesized that the impact on network latency should be negligent — if a user were using a connection slow enough where downloading a few more kilobytes matters, just about any Internet service would probably be too difficult to use anyway. But, considering the possible bandwidth and CPU savings, we decided to do an experiment to see if there were in fact any user-facing effects.\r\n",

This dropped the median response size of the main newsfeed endpoint from 15 KB to 10KB, while the median response size size of the “Explore Posts” endpoint dropped from 46 KB to 23 KB. This drop is even more pronounced when considering response sizes at higher percentiles: at the 95th percentile, median response size of the main feed endpoint dropped from 32 KB to 16 KB.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Results\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As expected, reducing the size of the payload by a few kilobytes had no perceptible impact on network latency. But it had a surprising impact on memory usage: reducing the average memory usage for each feed screen ended up significantly improving the stability of the entire app. Android out-of-memory (OOM) errors dropped 30%! We hypothesize that the difference between platforms results from the Android market: some Android phones come with very low amounts of RAM, and correspondingly high memory pressure.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Median CPU usage on our most popular endpoints, like the main feed endpoint, dropped 20%! This translated into a median savings of 30ms in server-side wall time (and thus reduced end-to-end latency), and at the 95th percentile, we saved 70ms in server-side wall time. That makes a difference!\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "When we launched this across all our users, CPU across our entire Django fleet dropped about 8% and egress dropped about 25%.

      "\r\n",
      "During the A/B test, we saw app-wide impressions across all mobile platforms increase by 0.7%, and likes increase by 0.4%.

      "Engineering Refactoring a javascript video store The simple example of calculating and formatting a bill for a video store opened my refactoring book in 1999. If done in modern JavaScript, there are several directions you could take the refactoring. I explore four here: refactoring to top level functions, to a nested function with a dispatcher, using classes, and transformation using an intermediate data structure.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Many years ago, when I was writing the refactoring book, I opened the book with a (very) simple example of refactoring some code that calculated a customer's bill for renting some videos (in those days we had to go to a store to do that). I was contemplating this refactoring example recently, in particular how it would look if it were written in modern JavaScript.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Any refactoring is about improving the code in a particular direction, one that suits a development team's coding style. In the book the example was in Java, and Java (particularly then) suggests a certain style of coding, an object-oriented style. With JavaScript, however, there is a lot more options about what kind of style to go for. While you can do a Java-like OO style, particularly with ES6 (Ecmascript 2015), not all JavaScript pundits favor that style, many indeed consider using classes to be a Bad Thing.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This initial video store code To explore further, I need to introduce some code. In this case a JavaScript version of the original example I wrote back at the turn of the century. function statement(customer, movies) { let totalAmount = 0; let frequentRenterPoints = 0; let result = `Rental Record for ${customer.name}\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "`; return result; } I'm using ES6 here. The code operates on two data structures, both of which are just lists of json records. A customer record looks like this { \"name\": \"martin\", \"rentals\": [ {\"movieID\": \"F001\", \"days\": 3}, {\"movieID\": \"F002\", \"days\": 1}, ] } The movies structure looks like this { \"F001\": {\"title\": \"Ran\", \"code\": \"regular\"}, \"F002\": {\"title\": \"Trois Couleurs: Bleu\", \"code\": \"regular\"}, // etc } In the original book, movies were just present as objects in the java object structure. For this essay I prefer passing in the json structure as a parameter. I will assume using some kind of global lookup, such as a Repository, is not appropriate for this application. The statement method prints out a simple text output of a rental statement Rental Record for martin Ran 3.5 Trois Couleurs: Bleu 2 Amount owed is 5.5 You earned 2 frequent renter points This output is crude, even by the standards of example code. Could I not even be bothered to format the numbers decently? Remember, however, that the book was written with Java 1.1, before String.format was added to the language. That may partially forgive my laziness. The statement function is an example of the smell Long Method. Just its size is enough to make me suspicious. But just because code smells bad isn't enough of a reason on its own to refactor it. Poorly factored code is a problem because it's hard to understand. Code that's hard to understand is hard to modify, whether to add new features or to debug. So if you don't need to to read and understand some code, then its poor structure won't harm you and you can happily leave it alone for a while. So to trigger our interest in this code fragment, we need a reason for it to change. Our reason, as I used in the book, is to write an HTML version of the statement method, something that prints out something like this. <h1>Rental Record for <em>martin</em></h1> <table> <tr><td>Ran</td><td>3.5</td></tr> <tr><td>Trois Couleurs: Bleu</td><td>2</td></tr> </table> <p>Amount owed is <em>5.5</em></p> <p>You earned <em>2</em> frequent renter points</p> As I indicated earlier, in this essay I'm exploring a number of ways in which I can refactor this code to make it easier to add additional output renderings. All of these have the same start: breaking down the single method into a set of functions to capture different parts of the logic. Once I've done this break down, I'll explore four different ways these functions can be arranged to support alternative renderings.\r\n",

The core code of the function is 7 lines, and is all concerned with formatting the output string. All the calculation code is moved to its own set of nested functions, each of which is small and clearly named to show its purpose. But I'm still not quite in a position to write the html emitting function. The decomposed functions are all nested inside the overall statement function, this makes it easier to extract the functions as they can refer to names inside the function scope, which includes each other (such as amountFor calling movieFor ) and the supplied parameters customer and movie . But I can't write a simple htmlStatement function that references those functions. To be able to support some different outputs using the same calculations, I need to do some further refactorings. Now I reach a point where I have several options of which refactorings to do depending on how I like to factor my code. I'll run through each of these approaches next, explaining how each one works, and then compare them once I'm done with all four.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Using a parameter to determine the output One route I could take is to specify the output format as an argument to the statement function.

      "\r\n",
      "Using top-level functions The problem with writing a top-level html statement function is that the calculation functions are nested inside the text statement function. So an obvious way to proceed is to move them to the top context. To do this, I begin by looking for function that doesn't refer to any others, in this case movieFor Whenever I move functions around, I like to do it by first copying the function to the new context, fitting it to that context, and then replacing the original function body with a call to the moved function. function topMovieFor(rental, movies) { return movies[rental.movieID]; } function statement(customer, movies) { // [snip] function movieFor(rental) { return topMovieFor(rental, movies) ; } function frequentRenterPointsFor(rental) { return (movieFor(rental).code === \"new\" && rental.days > 2) ? 2 : 1; } I can compile and test at this point, which will tell me if the change in context has caused any trouble.

So sometimes it can be useful to declare a local function that calls the global function with some, or all, of the parameters filled in. That local function, which is a partial application of the global function, can then be used later on. There's various ways to do this in JavaScript. One is to assign the local functions to variables. function htmlStatement(customer, movies) { const amount = () => totalAmount(customer, movies); const frequentRenterPoints = () => totalFrequentRenterPoints(customer, movies); const movie = (aRental) => movieFor(aRental, movies); const rentalAmount = (aRental) => amountFor(aRental, movies); let result = `<h1>Rental Record for <em>${customer.name}</em></h1>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "`; result += \"<table>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"; for (let r of customer.rentals) { result += ` <tr><td>${ movie(r) .title}</td><td>${ rentalAmount(r) }</td></tr>\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "`; result += `<p>You earned <em>${ frequentRenterPoints() }</em> frequent renter points</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "`; return result; } Another is to declare them as nested functions. function htmlStatement(customer, movies) { let result = `<h1>Rental Record for <em>${customer.name}</em></h1>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "`; result += \"<table>\r\n",

Constructor functions ( createCustomer and createRental ) return a JavaScript object (hash) of function references. Each constructor function contains a closure that holds the object's data. Because the returned object of functions are in the same function context they can access this data. I see this as exactly the same pattern as using the class syntax, but implemented a different way. I prefer to use the explicit syntax since it is more explicit - thus making my thinking clearer.\r\n",

      "Data Transformation All of these approaches have involved the statement printing functions calling other functions to calculate the data they need. Another approach to do this is to pass this data to the statement printing functions in the data structure itself. In this approach the calculation functions are used to transform the customer data structure so that it has all the data the printing functions need. In refactoring terms this is an example of not-yet-written Split Phase refactoring that Kent Beck described to me last summer. With this refactoring I split the computation into two phases that communicate using an intermediate data structure. I begin this refactoring by introducing the intermediate data structure. function statement(customer, movies) { const data = createStatementData(customer, movies); let result = `Rental Record for ${ data .name}\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "`; return result; function createStatementData(customer, movies) { let result = Object.assign({}, customer); return result; } For this case I'm enriching the original customer data structure with added elements, hence starting with a call to Object.assign . I could also make an entirely new data structure, the choice really depends on how different the transformed data structure is to the original. I then do the same thing for each line of rental function statement… function createStatementData(customer, movies) { let result = Object.assign({}, customer); result.rentals = customer.rentals.map(r => createRentalData(r)); return result; function createRentalData(rental) { let result = Object.assign({}, rental); return result; } } Notice that I nest createRentalData inside createStatementData since any caller of createStatementData won't need to know about how the inside is built up. I can then start to populate the transformed data, beginning with the title of the rented movie. function statement(customer, movies) { const data = createStatementData(customer, movies); let result = `Rental Record for ${data.name}\r\n",

First I move all the calculation functions inside createStatementData function statement (customer, movies) { // body … function createStatementData (customer, movies) { // body … function createRentalData(rental) { … } function totalFrequentRenterPoints() { … } function totalAmount() { … } function movieFor(rental) { … } function amountFor(rental) { … } function frequentRenterPointsFor(rental) { … } } } Then I move createStatementData outside of statement . function statement (customer, movies) { … } function createStatementData (customer, movies) { function createRentalData(rental) { … } function totalFrequentRenterPoints() { … } function totalAmount() { … } function movieFor(rental) { … } function amountFor(rental) { … } function frequentRenterPointsFor(rental) { … } } Once I've separated the functions like this, I can write the HTML version of the statement to use the same data structure. function htmlStatement(customer, movies) { const data = createStatementData(customer, movies); let result = `<h1>Rental Record for <em>${data.name}</em></h1>\r\n",

      "`; result += `<p>You earned <em>${data.totalFrequentRenterPoints}</em> frequent renter points</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "`; return result; } I can also move createStatementData to a separate module to further clarify the boundaries between calculating the data and rendering the statements. statement.es6 import createStatementData from './createStatementData.es6'; function htmlStatement(customer, movies) { … } function statement(customer, movies) { … } createStatementData.es6 export default function createStatementData (customer, movies) { function createRentalData(rental) { … } function totalFrequentRenterPoints() { … } function totalAmount() { … } function movieFor(rental) { … } function amountFor(rental) { … } function frequentRenterPointsFor(rental) { … } }\r\n",

      "Comparing the approaches So now it's time to step back and take a look at what I've got. I have an initial body of code, written as a single inline function. I wished to refactor this code to enable an html rendering without duplicating the calculation code. My first step was to break this code up into several functions, living within the original function . From there, I explored four distinct paths: top-level-functions write all functions as top-level functions function htmlStatement(customer, movies) function textStatement(customer, movies) function totalAmount(customer, movies) function totalFrequentRenterPoints(customer, movies) function amountFor(rental, movies) function frequentRenterPointsFor(rental, movies) function movieFor(rental, movies) show code parameter-dispatch use a parameter to the top-level function to state what format of output to emit function statement(customer, movies, format) function htmlStatement() function textStatement() function totalAmount() function totalFrequentRenterPoints() function amountFor(rental) function frequentRenterPointsFor(rental) function movieFor(rental) show code classes move calculation logic to classes which are used by rendering functions function textStatement(customer, movies) function htmlStatement(customer, movies) class Customer get amount() get frequentRenterPoints() get rentals() class Rental get amount() get frequentRenterPoints() get movie() show code transform split calculation logic into separate nested function that produces an intermediate data structure for the rendering functions function statement(customer, movies) function htmlStatement(customer, movies) function createStatementData(customer, movies) function createRentalData() function totalAmount() function totalFrequentRenterPoints() function amountFor(rental) function frequentRenterPointsFor(rental) function movieFor(rental) show code I'll begin with the top-level-functions example as my baseline for comparison is it's the conceptually simplest alternative.[2] It's simple because it divides the work into a set of pure functions, all of which are callable from any point in my code. This is simple to use and simple to test - I can test any individual function easily via either test cases or with a REPL. The downside with top-level-functions is that there's a lot of repetitive parameter passing. Each function needs to be given the movies data structure and the customer level functions also to be given a customer structure. I'm not concerned about the repetitive typing here, but I am concerned about the repetitive reading. Each time I read the parameters I have to figure out what they are and check to see if the parameters are changing. For all these functions, the customer and the movies data are common context - but with top-level-functions that common context isn't made explicit. I infer it as I read the program and build the model of its execution in my mind, but I prefer things to be as explicit as possible. This factor becomes more important as that context grows. I have only two data items here, but it's not uncommon to find many more. Using top-level functions alone I end up with large parameter lists on every call, each one adding to the load on my reading comprehension. This can lead to the trap of bundling all these parameters into a context parameter, which contains all context for many functions, and ends up obscuring what these functions do. I can reduce the pain of all this by defining local partially-applied functions, but that's a lot of extra function declaring to throw in the mix — which has to be duplicated with each bit of client code. The advantage of the three other alternatives is that they each make the common context explicit, capturing it within the structure of the program. The parameter-dispatch approach does this by capturing the context in the top level parameter list, which is then available as common context to all nested functions. This works particularly well with the original code, making the refactoring from single function to nested functions simpler than a language that lacks nested functions. But the parameter-dispatch approach starts to wobble when I need different overall behaviors from my context, such as an html format response. I need to write some kind of dispatcher to decide which function I want to invoke. Specifying a format to a renderer isn't too bad, but such dispatch logic is a distinct smell. However I write it, it's still essentially duplicating the core ability of the language to call a named function. I'm heading down a path that can quickly lead me to the nonsense of: function executeFunction (name, args) { const dispatchTable = { //... There is a context for this kind of approach, which is when the choice of output format does come to my caller as data. In that case there has to be a dispatch mechanism on that data item. However if my callers are calling the statement function like this… const someValue = statement(customer, movieList, 'text'); …then there's no way I should be writing dispatch logic in my code. The calling method is the key here. Using literal values to indicate choice of function is a smell. Instead of this API, let the caller say what they want as part of the function name, textStatement or htmlStatement . Then I can use the language's function dispatch mechanism and avoid cobbling together something else myself. So with these two alternatives under my belt, where am I? I want some explicit common context for some logic, but need to call different operations using that logic. When I feel this kind of need, I immediately think of using object-orientation - which is in essence a set independently invokable operations on a common context. [3] This leads me to the classes version of the example, which allows me to capture the common context of the customer and movies within the customer and rental objects. I set the context once when I instantiate the objects, and then all further logic can use that common context. The object methods are like the partially applied local functions in the top-level case, except that here the common context is supplied by the constructor. I thus only write the local functions, not the top-level ones. The caller indicates the context with the constructor and then calls the local function directly. I can think of the local methods as partial applications of notional top-level functions on the common context of the object instance. Using classes introduces a further notion - that of separating the rendering logic from the calculation logic. One of the faults of the original single function is that it mixes the two together. Splitting into functions separates them to some degree, but they all still exist in the same conceptual space. That's a touch unfair, I could put the calculation functions into one file and the rendering functions into another, linking them by appropriate import statements. But I find that a common context provides a natural hint for how to group logic into modules. I've described the objects as a set of common partial applications, but there's another way to look at them. The objects are instantiated with an input data structure, but enrich this data with computed data exposed through their calculation functions. I've reinforced this way of thinking by making these getters, so a client treats them exactly the same as raw data - applying the Uniform Access Principle. I can think of this as a transformation from the constructor argument to this virtual data structure of getters. The transform example is the same idea, but implemented by creating a new data structure that combines the initial data with all the calculated data. Just as the objects encapsulate the calculation logic inside the customer and rental classes, the transform approach encapsulates that logic inside createStatementData and createRentalData . This approach of transforming basic List And Hash data structures is a common feature of much functional thinking. It allows the create…Data functions to share the context that they need and the rendering logic to use the multiple outputs in a simple manner. One minor difference between thinking of the class as a transform and transform approach itself is when the transform computation happens. The transform approach here transforms all at once, while the classes make individual transforms with each call. I can easily switch when the computation happens to match the other. In the classes case I can perform all computation at once by doing it in the constructor. For the transform case I can recompute on demand by returning functions in the intermediate data structure. Almost always the performance differences here will be insignificant, if any of these functions is expensive my best bet is usually to use a method/function and cache the result after the first call. So there are four approaches - what is my preference? I don't care for writing dispatcher logic, so I wouldn't use the parameter-dispatch approach. The top-level-functions are something I'd consider, but my taste for them plummets rapidly as the shared context increases in size. Even with only two arguments, I'd be inclined to reach for the other alternatives. Choosing between the classes and transform approach is harder, both provide a good way of making common context explicit and separating concerns well. I don't care for cage fights, so maybe I just make them play tiddlywinks and pick the winner.\r\n",

      "Further Refactorings In this exploration, I've explored four ways of arranging the calculation and rendering functions. Software is a very malleable medium and there are more variations that could be done with this, but these are the four that I think are the most interesting to discuss. There are also further refactorings than just the arrangement of these functions. In the book example I decomposed the amount and frequentRenterPoint calculations to support extending the model with new movie types. There are changes I'd make to the rendering code, such as pulling out a common pattern of header, lines, and footer. But I think the four paths are enough to think about for this article. My conclusion, if I have one, is that there are different ways to sensibly arrange observably identical computation. Different languages encourage certain styles - the original book refactoring was done in Java, which greatly encourages the classes style. JavaScript handily supports multiple styles, which is good because it provides the programmer with options, and bad because it supplies the programmer with options. (One of the difficulties in programming in JavaScript is that there is little consensus on what is good style.) It's useful to understand these different styles, but more important to realize what ties them together. Small functions, providing they are well-named, can be combined and manipulated to support varied needs both at the same time and over time. Common contexts suggest grouping logic together, while much of the art of programming is deciding how to separate concerns into a clear set of such contexts.\n",

      "Billing, as most of you would agree, is the critical service for any company. The database is the most essential element in any migration and getting it right determines the success or failure of the whole project. The Netflix CDE (Cloud Database Engineering) team was tasked with migrating this critical subsystem database. The following sections describe some of key areas we focused on in order to ensure a successful migration.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Think of any challenge in database migration and pretty much all of them were there in this migration:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Have you ever wondered about the elements that need to come together and align to get a complicated database migration right? You might ask, “What makes it complicated?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In this post, the database migration portion will be covered in detail. We hope that our experiences will help you as you undertake your own migrations.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In the billing migration blog post published a few weeks ago, we explained the overall approach employed in migrating our billing system to the cloud:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In case of the primary MySQL database failure, a failover is performed to the DRBD secondary node that was being replicated in synchronous mode. Once secondary node takes over the primary role, the route53 DNS entry for database host is changed to point to the new primary. The billing application being batch in nature is designed to handle such downtime scenarios. The client connection do not fallback but establish new connections that would point to the new primary after the Cname propagation is complete.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Read replica setup in local, as well as cross region, not only met high availability requirements, but also helped with scalability . The read traffic from ETL jobs was diverted to the read replica, sparing the primary database from heavy ETL batch processing.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Using an DRBD copy in another zone for the primary master DB, helped withstand zone outages, infrastructure failures like bad nodes, and EBS volume failures. “Synchronous replication protocol” was used to enable the write operations on the primary node to be considered completed, only after both the local and remote writes have been confirmed. As a result, the loss of a single node is guaranteed to have no data loss. This would impact the write latency, but that was well within the SLAs.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "High availability and scalability were the main drivers in designing the architecture to help the billing application withstand infrastructure failures, zone and region outages, and to do so with minimal downtime.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "EC2 MySQL : EC2 MySQL was ultimately the choice for the billing use case, since there were no licensing cost and it also provided a path to future Aurora migration. This involved setting up MySQL using the InnoDB engine on i2.8xlarge instances.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "PostgreSQL : PostgreSQL is a powerful open source, object-relational database system, but we did not have much in house expertise using PostgreSQL. In the DC, our primary backend databases were Oracle and MySQL. Moreover, choosing PostgreSQL would have eliminated the option of a seamless migration to Aurora in future, as Aurora is based on the MySQL engine.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "AWS Aurora : AWS Aurora would have met the storage needs, but it was in beta at that time.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "AWS RDS MySQL : Ideally we would have gone with MySQL RDS as our backend, considering Amazon does a great job in managing and upgrading relational database as a service, providing multi-AZ support for high availability. However, the main drawback to RDS was the storage limit of 6TB. Our requirement at the time, was closer to 10TB.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Oracle : As source database was in Oracle, migrating to Oracle in Cloud would avoid cross database migration, simplifying the coding effort and configuration setup. Our experience with Oracle in production gave more confidence with respect to its performance and scalability. However, considering the licensing costs and the technical debt required to migrate legacy data “as is”, prompted us to explore other options.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Choice of Migration Tool\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "We spent considerable time and effort in choosing the right tool for the migration. Primary success criteria for the POC was the ability to restart bulk loads, bi-directional replication, and data integrity. We focused on the following criteria while evaluating a tool for the migration.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Restart bulk/incremental loads\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Bi-directional replication\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Parallelism per table\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Data integrity\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Error reporting during transfer\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Ability to rollback after going live\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Performance\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Ease of use\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "GoldenGate stood out in terms of features it offered which aligned very well with our use case. It offered the ability to restart bulk loads in case of failures (a few tables were hundreds of GB in size), and its bi-directional replication feature provided easy rollback from MySQL to Oracle.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The main drawback with GoldenGate was the learning curve in understanding how the tool works. In addition, its manual configuration setup is prone to human error, which added a layer of difficulty. If there is no primary key or unique key on the source table, GoldenGate uses all columns as the supplemental logging key pair for both extracts and replicats. We found issues like duplicate data at the target in incremental loads for such tables and decided to execute a full load during the cutover for those specific tables with no pre-defined primary or unique key. The advantages and features offered by GoldenGate far exceeded any challenges and was the tool of choice.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Schema Conversion and Validation\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Since source and target databases were different, with data type and data length differences, validation became a crucial step in getting the data migrated while keeping the data integrity intact.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Data type mismatch took sometime to fix the issues stemming from it. One example — many numeric values in Oracle were defined as the Number datatype for legacy reasons. There is no equivalent type in MySQL. The Number datatype in Oracle stores fixed and floating-point numbers which was tricky. Some source tables had columns where Number meant an integer, in other cases it was used for decimal values, while some had really long values up to 38 digits. In contrast, MySQL has specific datatypes like Int, bigInt, decimal, double etc and a bigInt cannot go beyond 18 digits. One should ensure that correct mapping is done to reflect the accurate values in MySQL.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Partitioned tables needed special handling, since unlike Oracle, MySQL expects the partition key to be the part of the primary key and unique key. Target schema had to be redefined with proper partitioning keys to ensure no negative impact on application logic and queries.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Default value handling also differs between MySQL and Oracle. For the columns with a NOT NULL value, MySQL determined the implicit default value for the column. Strict mode had to be enabled in MySQL to catch such data conversion issues, as such transactions would fail and show up in the GoldenGate error logs.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Tools for schema conversion: We researched a variety of tools to assist in schema conversion as well as validation, but the default schema conversion provided by these tools did not work due to our legacy schema design. Even GoldenGate does not convert Oracle schema to the equivalent MySQL version, but instead depends on the application owners to define the schema first. Since one of our goals with this migration was to optimize schema, the database and application teams worked together to review the data types, and did multiple iterations to capture any mismatch. GoldenGate will truncate the value to fit the MySQL datatype in case of a mis-match. We relied heavily on data comparison tools and the GoldenGate error logs to help detect mismatches in data type mapping between source and target, in order to mitigate this issue.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Data Integrity\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Once the full load completed and incrementals caught up, another daunting task was to make sure the target copy correctly maintained the data integrity. As the data types between Oracle and MySQL were different, it was not possible to have a generic wrapper script to compare hash values for the rowkeys to ensure accuracy. There are a few 3rd party tools which do the data comparisons across databases comparing the actual values, but the total dataset is 10 TB which was not easy to compare. Instead, we used these tools to match a sample data set which helped in identifying a few discrepancies related to wrong schema mapping.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Test refreshes: One of the ways to ensure data integrity was to do the application testing on a copy of the production database. This was accomplished by scheduling database refreshes from the MySQL production database to test. Considering production was being backed by EBS for storage, a test environment was easily created by taking the EBS snapshots off the slave, and doing a point in time recovery into test. This process was repeated several times to ensure data quality.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sqoop jobs: ETL jobs and reporting were used to help with data reconciliation process. Sqoop jobs pulled data out of Oracle for reporting purposes. Those jobs were also configured to run against MySQL. With continuous replication between source and target, reports were run against specific time window on the ETLs. This helped in taking out the variation due to incremental loads.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Row counts was another technique used to compare the source/target and match them. This was achieved by pausing the incremental loads on the target and matching the counts on Oracle and MySQL. Results from row counts were also compared after full GoldenGate load of the tables.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Performance Tuning\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Infrastructure: Billing application persisted data in the DC on two Oracle databases residing on very powerful machines, using IBM power 7, 32 dual core 64 bit multiprocessors, 750GB RAM, TB’s storage allocated via SVC MCS cluster which is 8G4 cluster with 4GB/sec interface running with RAID 10 configurations.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "One major concern with the migration was performance, as the target database was consolidated on one i2.8xlarge server, using 32 vCPU and 244 GB RAM. The application team did a lot of tuning at the application layer to optimize the queries. With the help of Vector the performance team was able to find bottlenecks and eliminate them by tuning specific system and kernel parameters. See Appendix for more details.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "High performance with respect to reads and writes was achieved by using RAID0 with EBS provisioned IOPS volumes. To get more throughput per volume, 5 volumes of 4TB each were used, instead of 1 big volume. This was to facilitate faster snapshots and restores.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Database: One major concern using MySQL was the scale of our data and MySQL throughput during batch processing of data by billing applications. Percona provided consulting support, and the MySQL database was tuned to perform well during and after the migration. The main trick is to have two cnf files, one while migrating the data and tweaking parameters like innodb_log_file_size to help with bulk inserts, and the second cnf file for the real time production application load by tweaking parameters like innodb_buffer_pool_instances to help with the transaction real time load. See Appendix for more details.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Data load: During POC, we tested the initial table load with indexes in on/off combination and decided to go with enabling all indexes before the load. The reasoning behind this was that index creation in MySQL is single threaded (most tables had multiple indexes), and so we instead utilized Golden Gate’s parallel load feature to populate the table with indexes in reasonable time. Foreign key constraints were enabled during the final cutover.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Another trick we learned was to match the total number of processes executing full and incremental load, to the number of cores on the instance. If the processes exceeded the number of cores, the performance of those data loads slowed down drastically as the instance would spend a lot of time in context switches. It took around 2 weeks to populate 10 TB in target MySQL database with the full loads and have incremental loads catch up.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Conclusion\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Though the database piece is one of the most challenging aspects of any migration, what really makes a difference between success and failure is ensuring you are investing in the right approach up front, and partnering closely with the application team throughout the process. Looking back on the whole migration, it was truly a commendable effort by different teams across the organization, who came together to define the whole migration and make the migration a great success! Along with the individual and cross team coordination, it’s also the great culture of freedom and responsibility which makes these challenging migrations possible without impacting business.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Netflix uses Apache Mesos to run a mix of batch, stream processing, and service style workloads. For over two years, we have seen an increased usage for a variety of use cases including real time anomaly detection, training and model building batch jobs, machine learning orchestration, and Node.js based microservices. The recent release of Apache Mesos 1.0 represents maturity of the technology that has evolved significantly since we first started to experiment with it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Our initial use of Apache Mesos was motivated by fine grained resource allocation to tasks of various sizes that can be bin packed to a single EC2 instance. In the absence of Mesos, or a similar resource manager, we would have had to forego fine grained allocation for increased number of instances with suboptimal usage, or develop a technology similar to Mesos, or at least a subset of it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The increasing adoption of containers for stream processing and batch jobs continues to drive usage in Mesos-based resource scheduling. More recently, developer benefits from working with Docker-based containers brought in a set of service style workloads on Mesos clusters. We present here an overview of some of the projects using Apache Mesos across Netflix engineering. We show the different use cases they address and how they each use the technology effectively. For further details on each of the projects, we provide links to other posts in sections below.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Cloud native scheduling using Apache Mesos\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In order to allocate resources from various EC2 instances to tasks, we need a resource manager that makes the resources available for scheduling and carries out the logistics of launching and monitoring the tasks over a distributed set of EC2 instances. Apache Mesos separates out resource allocation to “frameworks” that wish to use the cluster, from scheduling of resources to tasks by the frameworks. While Mesos determines how many resources are allocated to a framework, the framework’s scheduler determines which resources to assign to which tasks, and when. The schedulers are presented a relatively simple API so they can focus on the scheduling logic and react to failures, which are inevitable in a distributed system. This allows users to write different schedulers that cater to various use cases, instead of Mesos having to be the single monolithic scheduler for all use cases. The diagram below from Mesos documentation shows “Framework 1” receiving an offer from “Agent 1” and launching two tasks.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Mesos community has seen multiple schedulers developed over time that cater to specific use cases and present specific APIs to their users.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Netflix runs various microservices in an elastic cloud, AWS EC2. Operating Mesos clusters in a cloud native environment required us to ensure that the schedulers can handle two aspects in addition to what the schedulers that operate in a data center environment do — increased ephemerality of the agents running the tasks, and the ability to autoscale the Mesos agent cluster based on demand. Also, the use cases we had in mind called for a more advanced scheduling of resources than a first fit kind of assignment. For example, bin packing of tasks to agents by their use of CPUs, memory, and network bandwidth in order to minimize fragmentation of resources. Bin packing also helps us free up as many agents as possible to ease down scaling of the agent cluster by terminating idle agents without terminating running tasks.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Identifying a gap in such capabilities among the existing schedulers, last year we contributed a scheduling library called Fenzo. Fenzo autoscales the agent cluster based on demand and assigns resources to tasks based on multiple scheduling objectives composed via fitness criteria and constraints. The fitness criteria and the constraints are extensible via plugins, with a few common implementations built in, such as bin packing and spreading tasks of a job across EC2 availability zones for high availability. Any Mesos framework that runs on the JVM can use the Fenzo Java library.\r\n",

      "Mantis\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mantis is a reactive stream processing platform that operates as a cloud native service with a focus on operational data streams. Mantis covers varied use cases including real-time dashboarding, alerting, anomaly detection, metric generation, and ad-hoc interactive exploration of streaming data. We created Mantis to make it easy for teams to get access to real-time events and build applications on top of them. Currently, Mantis is processing event streams of up to 8 million events per second and running hundreds of stream-processing jobs around the clock. One such job focuses on individual titles, processing fine-grained insights to figure out if, for example, there are playback issues with House of Cards, Season 4, Episode 1 on iPads in Brazil. This amounts to tracking millions of unique combinations of data all the time.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Mantis platform comprises a master and an agent cluster. Users submit stream-processing applications as jobs that run as one or more workers on the agent cluster. The master uses the Fenzo scheduling library with Apache Mesos to optimally assign resources to a job’s workers. One such assignment objective places perpetual stream processing jobs on agents separate from those running transient interactive jobs. This helps scale down of the agent cluster when the transient jobs complete. The below diagram shows Mantis architecture. Workers from the various jobs may run on the same agent using Cgroups based resource isolation.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Titus\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Titus is a Docker container job management and execution platform. Initially, Titus served batch jobs that included algorithm training (similar titles for recommendations, A/B test cell analysis, etc.) as well as hourly ad-hoc reporting and analysis jobs. More recently, Titus has started to support service style jobs (Netflix microservices) that are in need of a consistent local development experience as well as more fine grained resource management. Titus’ initial service style use is for the API re-architecture using server side NodeJS.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The above architecture diagram for Titus shows its Master using Fenzo to assign resources from Mesos agents. Titus provides tight integration into the Netflix microservices and AWS ecosystem, including integrations for service discovery, software based load balancing, monitoring, and our CI/CD pipeline, Spinnaker. The ability to write custom executors in Mesos allows us to easily tune the container runtime to fit in with the rest of the ecosystem.\r\n",

      "Meson caters to a heterogeneous mix of jobs with varying resource requirements for CPU, memory, and disk space. It supports the running of Spark jobs along with other batch jobs in a shared cluster. Tasks are resource isolated on the agents using Cgroups based isolation. The Meson scheduler evaluates readiness of tasks based on a graph and launches the ready tasks using resource offers from Mesos. Failure handling includes re-launching failed tasks as well as terminating tasks determined to have gone astray.\r\n",

We engage with the Mesos community through our open source contribution, Fenzo, and by exchanging ideas at MesosCon conferences — connect with us at the upcoming MesosCon Europe 2016, or see our past sessions from 2014, 2015, and earlier this year (Lessons learned and Meson).\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Our future work on these projects includes adding SLAs (service level agreements — such as disparate capacity guarantees for service and batch style jobs), security hardening of agents and containers, increasing operational efficiency and visibility, and adoption across a broader set of use cases. There are exciting projects in the pipeline across Mesos, Fenzo, and our frameworks to make these and other efforts successful.\r\n",

      "Testing Search Queries\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Globalization at Netflix\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Having launched the Netflix service globally in January, we now support search in 190 countries. We currently support 20 languages, and this will continue to grow over time. Some of the most challenging language support was added while launching in Japan and Korea as well as in the Chinese and Arabic speaking countries. We have been working on tuning the language specific search prior to each launch by creating and tuning the localized datasets of the documents and their corresponding queries. While targeting a high recall for the launch of a new language, our ranking systems focus on increasing the precision by ranking the most relevant results high on the list.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In the pre-launch phase, we try to predict the types of failures the search system can have by creating a variety of test queries including exact matches, prefix matching, transliteration and misspelling. We then decide whether our generic field Solr configuration will be able to handle these cases or a language specific analysis is required, or a customized component needs to be added. For example, to handle the predicted transliterated name and title issues in Arabic, we added a new character mapping component on top of the traditional Arabic Solr analysis tools (like stemmer, normalization filter, etc), which increased the precision and recall for those specific cases. For more details, see the attachment description document and the patch for the LUCENE-7321.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Search support for languages follows the localization efforts, meaning we don’t support languages which are not on our localization path. These unsupported languages may still be searchable with untested quality. After the launch of localized search in a specific country, we analyze many metrics related to recall (zero results queries), and precision (click through rates, etc), and make further improvements. The test datasets are then used for regression control when the changes are introduced.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "We decided to open source the query testing framework we use for pre-launch and post launch regression analysis. This blog introduces a simple use case and describes how to install and use the tool with Solr or Elasticsearch search engine.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Motivation\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When retrieving search results, it is useful to know how the search system handles the language specific phenomena, like morphological variations, stopwords, etc. Standard tools might work well within most general cases, like English language search, but not as well with other languages. In order to measure the precision of the results, one could manually count the relevant results and then calculate the precision at result ‘k’. Doing so on a larger scale is problematic as it requires some set-up and possible customized UI to enter the ground truth judgments data.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Possibly an even harder challenge is to measure the recall. One needs to know all relevant documents in the collection in order to measure the recall. We developed an open source framework which attempts to make these challenges easier to tackle by allowing the testers to enter multiple valid queries per target document using Google spreadsheets. This way, there is no need for a specialized UI, and the focus of testing could be spent on entering the documents and related queries in the spreadsheet format. The dataset could be as small as a hundred documents, and a few hundred queries in order to collect the metrics which will help one tune the system for precision/recall. It is worth mentioning that this library is not concerned with the ranking of the results, but rather an initial tuning of the results, typically, optimized for recall. Other components are used to measure the relevancy of the ranking.\r\n",

      "Description\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Our query testing framework is a library which allows us to test a dataset of queries against a search engine. The focus is on the handling of tokens specific to different languages (word delimiters, special characters, morphemes, etc…). Different datasets are maintained in Google spreadsheets, which can be easily populated by the testers. This library then reads the datasets, runs the tests against the search engine and publishes the results. Our dataset has grown to be around 10K documents, over 20K queries, over 20 languages and is continuously growing.\r\n",

      "Although we have been using this on the short title fields, it is possible to use the framework against small-to-medium description fields as well.

      "I always thought (with no citation) that these were two distinct things. Competitive Advantage was a trait developed by a company to distance itself from rivals. Barrier to Entry was more like a trait inherent to an industry, which determined how hard it was for new firms to enter.\r\n",

      "This definition holds up, according to Investopedia:\r\n",

      "So you called a cab, but no one’s showing. The only thing the cranky dispatcher will say is “He’ll be there in 15.” You call back in 15, and he now says, “Driver’s on the way. Any minute now.” Click. It’s cold, it's getting dark, and you’re already late. Wouldn’t it be great if there was an app that let you tap into an unused supply of empty cabs and cars to get you where you want to go, perhaps with a little style? So goes the legendary inspiration behind Uber, a story now encapsulated in a single tagline: “Everyone’s private driver.”\n",
      "\n",
      "When it comes to persuasion, companies have traditionally appealed to the left side of the brain — logic, pricing, specs. Emotion, however, has proven to be the better marketing tool. As Daniel Pink, author of Drive, writes, “Right-brain dominance is the new source of competitive advantage.” Appealing to the right side of the brain allows for deeper engagement by uniting an idea with an emotion. The best way to do this: Tell a story.\n",
      "\n",
      "That said, the way you tell a company’s story is (and should be) quite different from the way you’d tell a story at a party. While the same techniques for success apply, too often business stories fall flat or set unnecessary fires, particularly in the domain of start-ups. You see it all the time. But in my experience, you can’t teach a company how to tell its story — just like you can’t teach someone to have a certain personality. Instead, I’ll give you the big don’ts.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Telling, not showing. One of the most fundamental maxims of storytelling is “Show, don’t tell” — and for a good reason. Rather than talking at your audience, telling them what to do or feel, share the story so that it unfolds naturally and your audience comes to their own conclusion themselves. People don’t just absorb facts and information. They actively listen to stories and, in real time, make their own inferences.\n",
      "\n",
      "When you're sharing a story, do so in a way that lets your audience envision the setting, picture the protagonist, and really feel the conflict that he or she is facing. Describe what’s happening as if the action is unfolding right now in front of you. As Mark Twain said:\n",
      "\n",
      "Don’t say the old lady screamed. Bring her on and let her scream.\n",
      "\n",
      "What this looks like in practice: Go to the “About Us” section on your website. Is it mostly text? Is the information pure data or are you using stories, personality and perhaps even humor to illustrate who you are?\n",
      "\n",
      "Also take an inventory of the tools you're using to share your company’s story. Done well, video is the most powerful antidote to the poison of telling. Rich in its ability to stimulate the senses visually and viscerally, it can convey complex ideas quickly, or emphasize subtle but important differences.\n",
      "\n",
      "A key example is FiftyThree, creator of a digital drawing tool that's a significant departure from other styluses on the market — particularly the way it folds in the best elements of analog tools. Called Pencil, it’s positioned as a better stylus, and unique in how it incorporates palm rejection. But rather than waste time explaining that terminology, or how Pencil is superior, the company released a beautifully shot narration-free video of artists actually creating with Pencil and demonstrating the intuitive quality of its features.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Too much jargon. We have all read countless press releases and seen presentations filled with nonsense words like synergy, platform, paradigm. What do they mean, anyway? We comfortably laugh at Alec Baldwin’s pompous character Jack on 30 Rock as he invents concepts like pos-mens (positive mentions) and upward-revenue-stream-dynamics, but to most people outside of our industry, we probably sound equally obtuse. Among the many plaudits heaped upon Steve Jobs, his emphasis on simplicity ranks high. You must recognize that it’s you and your product that need to fit your customer, not the other way around.\n",
      "\n",
      "In his introduction of the famous Think Different campaign, Jobs told his audience, \"To me marketing is about values. This is a very complicated world, it's a very noisy world, and we're not going to get a chance to get people to remember very much about us — no company is. So we have to be very clear about what we want them to know about us.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Filling a story with technical terms, acronyms and superfluous words is the best way to lose your audience. Hippocrates (MDs know him as \"The Oath Guy\") wrote: “The chief virtue that language can have is clearness, and nothing detracts from it so much as the use of unfamiliar words.”\n",
      "\n",
      "In Practice: Under Jobs, Apple adopted a relentlessly simple, humanistic mode of communication. Today, successors like Square (“Sell on the go.”),Venmo (“Make and share payments.”), and Evernote (“Remember everything.”) make important and often elaborate capabilities accessible. They do this by filling in the blank for their customers: “I really want to _______.” Then they do it.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Too impersonal. It doesn’t matter if your organization sells razors, builds cloud infrastructure, or designs medical devices, human beings are still driving the action. Personalize the protagonist of your story. Make her seem real enough so that the audience feels a stake in (and wants to know) what happens to her next.\n",

      "Subway famously took the opportunity to turn a true story into pure gold. College student Jared Fogle demonstrated that you can lose a ton of weight on a diet of Subway sandwiches. Much more compelling than promoting a slate of healthier new sandwich choices, here was a real-life story of a guy who Subway customers could connect to. And he was using their product to lead a better life. Originally written up in a campus newspaper, he was subsequently recognized as an asset by a local Subway franchise, then by Subway’s Chicago ad agency. Jared became the modest but quietly charismatic spokesperson for the brand. The Jared story ran as the lead campaign for Subway for 10 years — during which sales doubled.\n",

      "In practice: What could be more personal than a hard drive in the cloud? Practically anything, right? But as the saying goes, it’s all in how you use it. When Dropbox hit a big customer milestone, they celebrated by launching a site thanking their customers while encouraging them to share what Dropbox has enabled them to do. Some people wrote and stored novels, others shared baby photos with distant grandparents, still others lost and recovered their honors theses — all thanks to Dropbox. The continuously scrolling page filled with customer images and text submissions brings a whole new dimension to the company and, best of all, gets out of the way to let customers share what they care most about with each other.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Starting from the beginning. Unless you’re telling the story of how to land a plane safely or the proper assembly of an IKEA bookshelf, resist the urge to begin at the beginning. Chronology matters much less than having your story follow an interesting arc. And as luck would have it, the stuff you need to hook people doesn't tend to happen early on. Events need to build, one after the other, emotionally rather than sequentially. To really impact people, your story should describe increasing risk and increasing consequences until the final, inevitable conclusion — but not necessarily the one that the audience expects.\n",
      "\n",
      "As you think of the elements of the story you want to tell, imagine them as modules, first capturing them on Post-Its, then mixing them up. This easy exercise will break you of the oppressive habit of presenting things in order. Now, Post-Its in hand, think like a movie-maker. Open on a moment of truth. Make people feel it. Engage the senses. Then reach back to the past to savor the contrast. Even if people know how your story ends — it’s usually the product you’re asking them to buy — you can breathe life into the journey of how you got there, how your other customers discovered you, and why it’s made a difference.\n",
      "\n",
      "In practice: Bank of America chose to flip chronology in its recent Portraits campaign. Opening on an old couple taking a photo together, we start to go back in time with the couple’s extended family setting up and taking photos, reaching back in time through significant, often challenging events. Grandchildren disappear, adults become children, and we're left at the beginning: a young couple on a couch with their whole lives ahead of them. The effect is mesmerizing. What might have been a cloying, overly-sentimental ad is elevated with visual interest, a rare combination of creativity and familiarity that grabs attention and warms the heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Lack of conflict. Something always goes wrong in companies, particularly start-ups. But screw-ups also present opportunities to shine by telling a story of responsibility, apology and remedy. Not only are customers more loyal to brands that readily apologize, the backlash to brands that don’t own their mistakes are disproportionately costly.\n",

      "In practice: While some accused her of being slow on the uptake, Marissa Mayer seized the opportunity to humanize Yahoo’s brand and demonstrate leadership while offering a clear, sincere apology for last month's widespread email outage. She empathized with people and the problems the outage caused and took responsibility without making excuses. She even offered insight into the problem itself that anyone could identify with: “Unfortunately, the outage was much more complex than it seemed at first…” Hearing these few words, most people can think of a time when something similar happened to them.

      "6. Fabrication. Your story needs to be authentic. A major cancer center in Washington once asked a customer named Audrey, who happens to be a triathlete, if they could use her photo in a cancer awareness campaign. When the bus and magazine ads launched, much to the surprise of Audrey (and her large network of friends, family and fellow athletes), she was positioned as a cancer survivor. How much more powerful would this campaign have been if the featured image were that of an actual cancer survivor? For everyone who knows Audrey (or heard her story), this reputable institution has now tarnished its credibility forever. People want to hear and be moved by real stories.\n",

      "Make stories part of your culture — and more than that, the integrity of your culture. All-hands meetings can be pivotal here. Stories are often the best way to relate how a company is doing, what people are doing well, and what they could be doing better. And when leaders do this with transparency, honesty and humility, they make their employees feel good about their work — even if things aren’t all peachy.\n",
      "\n",
      "In practice: Capturing moments, good or bad, in story form can authentically connect your employees to your company, and increase their commitment to their work. Consider kicking off staff meetings with stories instead of progress reports. There are a few ways to do this. As you go around the room, ask everyone to briefly talk about the strangest thing that’s happened to them since the last meeting, or a customer story that involved the greatest amount of surprise. Did someone use your product in a new way? Did a hater become a believer?\n",

      "7. Proprietary. Companies with a stranglehold on what their corporate story is and who can tell it are missing a world of opportunities. And they're doing so at a time when social media makes it easier than ever to connect and share. Stories told by employees and by customers are incredible, sometimes invaluable assets (see Jared for Subway). Recognize the value in stories from internal and external sources, design ways to collect them, and enable your customers, advocates and employees to be storytellers too.\n",
      "\n",
      "The best tactic here is to create an internal “story bank,” or database of stories, where employees and even customers can write and submit stories complete with titles. These stories can then be tagged by keyword, so that people looking for particular anecdotes or examples can easily find them. This also makes it easy for employees browsing through customer stories to reach out to the authors.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nike, Apple and eBay all harness stories as tools to crowdsource ideas — especially what their consumers are really passionate about. In doing so, they give employees the language and initiative to tell personal stories of meaning, and to amplify and distribute brand initiatives in story form.\n",

      "In Practice: Comcast pioneered one of the very first effective campaigns on Twitter when it launched @ComcastCares. Once a hotbed of Comcast hate, Twitter became a huge brand building environment and customer service win for them. Comcast wrote the book on how people telling negative customer stories on social media (all-caps rants about poor cable service, photos of the cable guy asleep on their couch, etc.) could be co-opted and turned into authentic and powerful testimonials.\n",
      "\n",
      "To start, Comcast simply trolled Twitter for mentions of the company, identified complaints, and addressed individuals publicly on the platform. Employees introduced themselves by name (not as the faceless Comcast Customer service organization) and combined apology with sincere effort to help. Comcast quickly found that even the angriest individuals stop raging when a reasonable person is trying to help them in a public forum. From there, it built its strategy by acknowledging its negative image and visibly working to flip it on its head.\n",

      "On the other end of the spectrum, JPMorgan skipped these critical steps and discovered the hard way that the rosy story they were telling themselves (and wanted their audience to retell) was not what caught fire when they launched #AskJPM on Twitter. Misjudging both the medium and the moment, the hashtag that they thought would showcase sage financial advice solicited public outrage not seen since the original Occupy Wall Street protests. The company quickly shuttered the campaign, but #AskJPM lives on as a social media joke and cautionary tale. As content marketing increasingly becomes the norm, tactical storytelling is sure to be broken down to a science. But there’s danger in being overly reductionist. What makes good stories work is the same unpredictable, creative, unintuitive quality that makes humans human. Breakout success won’t follow from the rote application of step-by-step guides or how-tos. Design your strategy to avoid the seven sins above, however, and you’ll be in good shape to forge a voice of your own.\n",

      "Coming full circle, back to Uber, you can see how sparing, simple text is used to convey an authentic message that not only poses a problem, but presents an appealing solution in less than 30 words.

      "Startups & Business How To Choose The Right Business Ideas Somewhere along the continuum of the art versus science debate lies the topic of startup idea generation. It’s easy to draw the connection of an idea to a creative or artistic process — as any thought or idea is in and of itself a creation. But recent movements sparked by Lean Startup and Agile Methodology proponents, suggest that taking an iterative approach to both developing and validating ideas can greatly increase the chance that what once began as a simple idea could be transformed into a valuable organization, company, or movement one day.\n",

      "This article marks the beginning of the “Launch a Startup” series, where we’ll explore everything that goes on before you publicly launch your new company. The first step to creating something from nothing is uncovering the idea to do so. And so to kickoff the series, I’ll present you with a framework for generating startup ideas worth pursuing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course, it’s ultimately up to you to determine if something is worth doing or not. So, it’s best to consider this framework as one dedicated ‘self-validation tool’ in your toolbox. Subsequent posts will address external (or market) validation, building a founding team, developing a product or service, and the launching of your startup. But first, it all starts with questioning to uncover ideas with potential.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question 1: What Are You Passionate About?\n",
      "\n",
      "In your quest to have good ideas, you’ll need to embrace focus. And if you’re anything like me, focus and passion go hand in hand. That is, if I care about something deeply, I’m far more likely to spend quite a bit of time thinking about it, which turns out to be a good thing in considering how to generate actionable ideas.\n",
      "\n",
      "The good news is that you probably don’t have to ruminate on this question too much. If you’re passionate about your current job, your hobbies, or any other facet of your life, then you have at least one starting point. List these out and prioritize them to help you remain focused in your idea generating efforts.\n",
      "\n",
      "The bad news is that without passion, you’re not likely to get very far. Your ideas — as good as they may be — will sit on the shelf. This is why venture capitalists often cite passion in founders as one of the key criterion by which they judge a startup’s potential. So, if it’s one of those days where you’re feeling particularly uninspired or lacking in the passion department, use that time to embrace your inner intellectual curiosity. Learn. Read. Do. Passions are developed; we’re not born with them.\n",
      "\n",
      "For more on passion, the concept (and positivity) of ideas, as well as motivation to help you get started on your idea generation quest, head over to James Altucher’s blog.\n",

      "Question 2: Where Is the Pain?\n",
      "\n",
      "Having successfully focused in on your areas of interest, the next step is to explore areas of extreme pain within those categories. That is, areas that present problems and — in turn — opportunities for improvement. To effectively make this leap, you may have to get a bit more specific than you were in answering the first question.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, let’s say you’re passionate about education. What’s wrong with education? How can it be improved? In general, the answers to these questions are going to be very high-level (which isn’t necessarily a bad thing). You may, however, find that a more helpful way to approach education might be to break it down into smaller sub-categories.\n",
      "\n",
      "Accepting that everything is ultimately interconnected to some degree, better clarity (and more actionable ideas) typically flows from identifying the pain points for one specific group (e.g. preschool, collegiate mathematics, grade school applications, etc.).\n",
      "\n",
      "The more painful and prevalent a problem is, the greater the need for a solution. The greater the need for a solution, the more likely it is that people or companies will pay for one, and the more likely you can build a business from that solution.\n",
      "\n",
      "An important distinction to make, however, is that not all problems are painful. I call those empty opportunities. If you fall into the trap of pursuing an empty opportunity — one that isn’t built on a painful problem — you’ll quickly find that no one cares about your solution and, as a result, no one will pay you for your solution.\n",
      "\n",
      "A good way to avoid the empty opportunity mistake (which is one of the most common causes of startup failure) is to solve for a painful problem that you experience personally, either in the workplace or in your personal life. This way, the associated risk is not related to whether or not you’re solving a real problem but, rather, how many other people experience the problem you have.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Question 3: How Is This Pain Currently Being Alleviated?\n",
      "\n",
      "After you’ve identified some pain points within your field of passion, the next step is to start digging on existing solutions. In other words, what companies would you be competing with if you had an idea that solved your identified problem(s)?\n",
      "\n",
      "This step of the process is a double-edged sword, to be sure. If there is absolutely no one else out there working on solving the same problem you are, you invariably must ask yourself whether or not the pain is deep and widespread enough to be considered real.\n",
      "\n",
      "I personally subscribe to the notion that the startup market, mirroring the overall economy, is fairly efficient. This means that by the time a ‘real’ problem is recognizable, there are already some existing solutions available (some created specifically to address this problem, and some that could be considered substitute-type products or services). This is why startup success is often rightfully attributed to execution and not the originality of the founding idea.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the flip side, if there are many other solutions to the pain you’ve identified, you’ve validated that the pain is real but will inevitably face competition that has a head start on you in solving it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’d caution against doing a single Google search, looking at the top 20 results, and coming to a premature conclusion on the competitive landscape. Instead, tap your network, subscribe to related blog material, and allow yourself to be informed over days, weeks, months or longer — not seconds or minutes. With a thorough, open-minded approach, you’ll be developing domain expertise that can further feed your idea generating powers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question 4: Can It Be Done Better, Faster, or Cheaper?\n",
      "\n",
      "With a solid understanding of the existing solutions to the problems you’re passionate about solving, you’re now in a position to assess the opportunity. The opportunity can be defined as the delta between the existing solution and a ‘perfect’ solution. That is, how much room for improvement exists? Perfection would perhaps eliminate the problem and the associated pain forever, for all people and companies. Outside of healthcare, there are very few clear-cut examples of ‘perfect’ solutions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course, this step of the idea generation process is highly-subjective. What may be a sufficient solution to you may not be passable to someone else. This is where you’ll want to rely on your domain expertise to adequately flesh these assumptions out.\n",
      "\n",
      "Should you see an opportunity for improvement, what is it? Are you improving efficiency? Are you improving a product or service? Are you making an existing solution available for a new demographic? Are you making an existing solution available for cheaper? If even one of these areas can be addressed, you may be able to generate a good idea. If, on the other hand, you can address multiple problem areas with a single solution, you may be able to generate a great idea.\n",
      "\n",
      "This discussion on Quora can give you some insight as to the different approaches people take in considering startup opportunities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question 5: Can You Do It Better, Faster, or Cheaper?\n",
      "\n",
      "If you’ve made it this far, you’re on the brink of an idea that might not be terrible. The last step in the process is to have an honest discussion with yourself. This is the discussion that separates the dreamers from the doers. The question is, can you take the opportunity to solve a painful problem you’re passionate about and do something about it? If the answer is “Yes, here’s how:”, what follows is your idea.\n",
      "\n",
      "At this stage, don’t concern yourself with how right, wrong, good, or bad your idea is. Your idea(s) will undoubtedly evolve over time. The important thing is to have the idea itself. Write it down. Sleep on it. If, a week later, you find that that seed of an idea has grown into something that occupies your mind at all hours of the night, it might be time to take the next step.\n",
      "\n",
      "Go Henceforth and Ideate\n",
      "\n",
      "There are a few really important things to keep in mind as you explore the idea generation process.\n",
      "\n",
      "Most (good) ideas we have in life are probably not the result of a deliberate idea generation process. I’d call that organic idea generation — or, more simply, thinking.\n",
      "\n",
      "Organic idea generation likely includes breezing through some or all of the steps in this article subconsciously, to the extent that the ultimate idea you have seems very obvious at the moment that it pops into your head. In the realm of startup idea generation, this happens all of the time. It usually flows in a format similar to this:\n",
      "\n",
      "You encounter a problem.\n",
      "\n",
      "You construct a solution that alleviates the associated pain.\n",
      "\n",
      "It dawns on you “Maybe I could sell this solution to others!”\n",
      "\n",
      "The underlying concept, however, stays the same, that problem solving is the key.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Ideas (even great ones) are not easily translated into burgeoning startups. However, the more ideas you have, the greater the likelihood you have of identifying and taking action on a strong opportunity. It’s a great habit to dedicate yourself to strengthening your ‘idea muscle,’ as this also increases the likelihood that one of your organic ideas can be self-validated using a framework like the one provided in this article.\n",
      "\n",
      "Henry Ford once famously said that, “If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses.” Bottom line, we’re all opinionated — sometimes to the detriment of those trying to change things. And so while idea-centric feedback is certainly important, it’s perhaps equally important to take input from others with a grain or two of salt.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ideas are fragile. They come and go. But if you allow criticism to derail you at this stage, you’ll find yourself stuck on the idea treadmill unable to ever move forward. On their own, ideas are worthless. What stems from them, however, are the things that change the world.\n",
