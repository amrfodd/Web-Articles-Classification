## Web Article Classification 

This project is part of Knowledge officer Machine learning (ML) 
Track. This project is the first project in  the track.

# Motivation

Classify articles into categories based on their contents. Various classifiers were tried - Naive Bayesian Classifier and support vectors machine.

Installation
All libraries are avilable in Anaconda distribution of 
Python except the following library, you should install it:

Natural Language Toolkit - nltk library.
## Data

The dataset is avilable in knowledgeofficer website.

## File Descriptions

There are two folders. each for the used algorithms.

Each folder contains the data, the vectorized data, models, 
notebooks and the ReadME file on how to run the model.
## Summary

In this project, I used web articles dataset to classify the 
articles text. I used TF-IDF feature extraction algorithm and 
two different machine learning algorithms: 
Support Vector Machine ,Naive Bayes.
